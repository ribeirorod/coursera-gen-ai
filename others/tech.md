# Technical Workflow

## Infrastructure Setup (DevOps)

Our DevOps team plays a crucial role in setting up and maintaining the cloud infrastructure. Here's a step-by-step guide to their activities:

### 1. Requirements Gathering
The DevOps team collaborates with Business Analysts and clients to understand the specific requirements for the cloud infrastructure.

### 2. Cloud Provider Selection
Based on the requirements, they select the most suitable cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure etc.). Factors considered include cost, scalability, security features, and compatibility with other systems.

### 3. Infrastructure Design and Setup
Next, they design the infrastructure architecture considering aspects like data storage, compute resources, network configuration, and security measures. Once the design is finalized, they set up the infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

```bash
# Example of a Terraform script to create an AWS EC2 instance
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```
### 4. Configuration Management
They use configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the setup and manage the configuration of servers.

```yaml
# Example of an Ansible playbook to install Apache server
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
   - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: latest
```
### 5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
The DevOps team sets up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions. This automates the process of code deployment, reducing human errors and speeding up the development cycle.

```yaml
# Example of a GitLab CI/CD pipeline script
stages:
  - build
  - test

build:
  stage: build
  script: echo "Building the application"

test:
  stage: test
  script: echo "Testing the application"
```
### 6. Monitoring and Logging
They implement monitoring and logging solutions using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or cloud-native services. This helps in tracking the system's performance and troubleshooting issues.

```bash
# Example of a Prometheus configuration file
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```
### 7. Security Implementation
The DevOps team ensures that the infrastructure is secure by implementing measures like encryption, Identity and Access Management (IAM), firewalls, and regular vulnerability assessments.

### 8. Regular Updates and Maintenance
They perform regular updates to keep the infrastructure up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. They also carry out routine maintenance tasks like resource optimization, cost management, and resolving any issues that arise.

### 9. Disaster Recovery Planning
Lastly, they plan for disaster recovery by setting up regular backups and defining procedures for restoring services quickly in case of any outage or data loss.

By following these steps, our DevOps team ensures that the cloud infrastructure is robust, secure, efficient, and ready to support your business operations.

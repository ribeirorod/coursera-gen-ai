# Initial Business Workflow

Given the workflow you've shared, it's clear that we are dealing with a process that starts from customer acquisition to delivering AI-powered features. Here is an optimized version of that workflow:

## 1. Customer Acquisition
This remains as the first step. Our Sales & Marketing team will reach out to potential clients and present our unique value proposition.

## 2. Business Requirement Analysis
Once a client is on board, our Business Analysts from the BI team will work closely with the client to understand their specific needs and requirements.

## 3. Infrastructure Setup (DevOps)
Our DevOps Engineers will then set up the required cloud infrastructure based on the gathered requirements.
AWS: ECR > EKS > Managed Airflow > S3 > Snowflake

## 4. Data Pipeline Design (Data Engineering)
Next, our Data Engineers will design the initial main data pipelines necessary for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

## 5. Data Foundation Definition (DataOps)
Following this, our DataOps team will define the data foundation. This involves creating the first layer of data modeling that aligns with the business requirements.

## 6. Creation of Business Layer for Insights (BI)
Our BI Developers will then create the business layer on top of the data foundation. They'll generate insights and reports using BI tools. 

## 7. AI-Powered Features (MLOps - Optional)
If the client requires, our MLOps team can implement AI-powered features like predictive analytics, machine learning models etc.

## 8. Ongoing Support and Optimization
Finally, our Customer Support Team provides ongoing support to the client, while the rest of the tech teams continuously optimize the systems based on feedback and changing business needs.

By following this workflow, we ensure that each team contributes at the right stage and collaborates effectively with the others. It allows us to deliver a complete and efficient BI solution that adapts to the size and needs of any business.

# Initial Team Structure

Given the optimized workflow, it's clear that we'll need a multi-disciplinary team to meet all the requirements. Here's how we could structure our team:

## 1. Sales & Marketing Team
This team will be responsible for customer acquisition and client relationship management.

## 2. Business Analysts (BI Team)
They will gather and analyze the business requirements from the clients.

## 3. DevOps Engineers
They will set up and manage the cloud infrastructure necessary for our data pipelines and applications.

## 4. Data Engineers (Data Engineering Team)
This team will design and implement the main data pipelines for ETL processes.

## 5. DataOps Team
They are in charge of defining the data foundation, which includes the first layer of modeling.

## 6. BI Developers (BI Team)
BI Developers will create the business layer for generating insights and reports.

## 7. MLOps Team
If required by the client, this team will implement AI-powered features like predictive analytics, machine learning models, etc.

## 8. Customer Support Team
This team will provide ongoing support to the clients, helping them with any issues or queries they might have.

## 9. Management Team
Lastly, a strong management team is needed to oversee the operations, ensure smooth collaboration between different teams, and make strategic decisions.

This proposed team structure ensures that we have dedicated professionals at each stage of our workflow, maximizing efficiency and productivity.

## Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)
The course is primarily about large language models, their use cases, and how they work. LLMs are a subset of traditional machine learning that have been trained on trillions of words, finding statistical patterns in massive datasets of human-generated content. These models, with billions of parameters, exhibit emergent properties beyond just language comprehension.

## Generative AI
Generative AI refers to machines capable of creating content that mimics or approximates human ability. They can be used for various applications such as chat bots, generating images from text, or helping with code development. 

## Foundation Models
Foundation models, also known as base models, are the underlying models that power generative AI. The more parameters these models have, the more complex tasks they can perform. Throughout the course, we will be using an open-source model, flan-T5, for language tasks.

## Customized Solutions
These models can be used as-is or fine-tuned to adapt to specific use cases. This allows for rapid creation of customized solutions without the need to train a new model from scratch.

## Focus on Language Models
While generative AI models exist for multiple modalities, this course focuses on large language models and their uses in natural language generation.

## Interaction with LLMs
Interaction with language models is different than other machine learning and programming paradigms. LLMs take natural language instructions and perform tasks much like a human would. The text passed to an LLM is known as a prompt.

## Prompt Engineering
The space available to the prompt is called the context window. Inference refers to the process of using the model to generate text. The output is known as a completion, which includes both the original prompt and the generated text.

## Example
An example was given where the model was asked where Ganymede is located in the solar system. The model correctly identified Ganymede as a moon of Jupiter and generated a reasonable answer stating that the moon is located within Jupiter's orbit.

Throughout the course, you will see many examples of prompts and completions, learn how these models are built and trained, how to fine-tune them for your use cases, and how to deploy them to solve business and social tasks.

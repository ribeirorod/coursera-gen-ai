# Understanding Large Language Models and Transformer Architecture

## Transformer Architecture
The transformer architecture has significantly improved the performance of natural language tasks. Its power lies in its ability to learn the relevance and context of all words in a sentence, not just neighboring ones. This is achieved through attention weights applied to each word's relationship with others, regardless of their position in the input.

## Attention Map
An attention map illustrates the attention weights between each word and every other word. For example, the word "book" may be strongly connected with the words "teacher" and "student". This self-attention greatly improves the model's ability to encode language.

## Model Structure
The transformer architecture consists of two parts: the encoder and the decoder. They share several similarities and work together to process information.

## Tokenization
Before processing, texts are tokenized, converting words into numbers. Each number represents a position in a dictionary of all possible words that the model can handle. The chosen tokenizer should be used consistently when generating text.

## Embedding Layer
The input, now represented as numbers, is passed to the embedding layer. This space is where each token is represented as a vector and occupies a unique location. These vectors encode the meaning and context of individual tokens in the input sequence.

## Positional Encoding
Positional encoding is added to the base of the encoder or decoder along with the token vectors. This preserves information about word order and the relevance of the word's position in the sentence.

## Self-Attention Layer
The self-attention layer allows the model to analyze relationships between tokens in the input sequence. It captures the contextual dependencies between words through learned self-attention weights. 

## Multi-Headed Self-Attention
The transformer architecture includes multi-headed self-attention, where multiple sets of self-attention weights are learned independently. Each head may learn a different aspect of language, such as relationships between entities or activities in a sentence.

## Feed-Forward Network
After applying attention weights, the output is processed through a fully-connected feed-forward network. The output is a vector of logits proportional to the probability score for each token in the dictionary. These logits are normalized into a probability score for each word in a final softmax layer. The most likely predicted token has a higher score than the rest.


### Lecture Summary: Transformer Architecture Overview 

The lecture provides a comprehensive overview of the transformer architecture, originally designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation. A simple example is used to illustrate how a French phrase is translated into English using a transformer model.

1. **Tokenization**: The input words are tokenized using the same tokenizer that was used to train the network.
2. **Encoder**: The tokens are fed into the encoder through the embedding layer and multi-headed attention layers. The output is a deep representation of the structure and meaning of the input sequence.
3. **Decoder**: The encoded data is inserted into the decoder, which predicts the next token based on the context provided by the encoder. This loop continues until an end-of-sequence token is predicted.
4. **Detokenization**: The final sequence of tokens is detokenized into words, producing the output.

### Variations of Transformer Architecture

The lecture also discusses different variations of the transformer architecture:

1. **Encoder-only models**: These models work as sequence-to-sequence models but typically have input and output sequences of the same length. They can be further modified to perform classification tasks like sentiment analysis. An example is BERT.
2. **Encoder-decoder models**: These models excel at sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation where input and output sequences can have different lengths. They can also be trained for general text generation tasks. Examples include BART and T5.
3. **Decoder-only models**: These models are widely used today and can generalize to most tasks. Popular examples include the GPT family of models, BLOOM, Jurassic, LLaMA, etc.

### Prompt Engineering

The lecture emphasizes that while understanding the underlying architecture is beneficial, it's not necessary for interacting with transformer models. Instead, you'll be using natural language to create prompts, a process known as prompt engineering.

In summary, this lecture serves as a high-level overview of transformer models, providing enough background to understand the differences between various models and read model documentation. More detailed exploration will follow in later parts of the course.
